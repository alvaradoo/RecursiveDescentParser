# Recursive Descent Parser
Implemented a recursive descent parser and scanner in C++ for a context-free grammar (CFG) by writing a parsing function for each nonterminal symbol of the CFG.

Programming assignments were created by Dr. Gilbert Ndjatou from William Paterson University. This is my personal implementation of his assignment instructions. Not to be copied directly or replicated, only to be used for reference. 

Scanner_1 Folder contains language recognition functions for tokens and comments of a small programming language.
Scanner_2 Folder contains a scanner function for the tokens and comments of the programming language. 
Parser_3 Folder contains the recursive descent parser for the programming language.
